            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p> Hello! Welcome to my portfolio, where I hope you can learn a little bit about me. I'm currently a sophomore studying computer science at Binghamton University.
                Computer science has intrigued me ever since playing Minecraft introduced me to kids who were just as interested in coding. Besides programming, I enjoy a pretty
                mixed bag of activities. When I want to feel active, I like going hiking with friends or biking on my own on my favorite trails back home. Now that its too cold to
                do either, I just go to the gym. 
            </p>

            <p>To relax and unwind, there's nothing I like more than listening to music. From rock to rap, indie to pop, and English to Spanish, I'd say I have a pretty versatile taste in music. 
               To give you an idea, these are some of my favorite albums at the moment:

            </div>
            <br>  
            <p>When I'm not listening to my favorite artists, I'll probably be watching one of my favorite shows,
                like Veep, Parks and Rec, Grey's Anatomy or Game of Thrones. Or I'll be in the middle of a YouTube binge, which can be pretty hard to snap out of!

            <p> 
                But there's a lot more to me than my favorite shows or music. I'm also really interested in politics, and strongly believe it's important to be cognizant of how the current political climate can impact different communities.   
                One of the issues I'm most passionate about is the environment. I would love to be able to combine computer science with green/renewable energy somehow in the future!

                At my school's last hackathon, I teamed up with three friends to work on a project called "Green4Green"
                which would analyze people's monthly budget and offer short, medium, and long term solutions to living more sustainably.

            <h3>Favorite Pictures Gallery</h3>
            <p> 
                My friends have definitely influenced my photography, so naturally my favorite pictures are the ones I take when I'm with them. 
                But I've also developed my own photographic preferences. My favorite views to capture usually include architecture, plants, and FOOD!
